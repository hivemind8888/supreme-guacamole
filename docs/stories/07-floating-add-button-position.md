# User Story: 7 - Floating Add Button Positioned in Lower Right Corner âœ…

**Status:** [x] COMPLETED

**As a** recipe contributor,  
**I want** the add recipe button to be floating in the lower right corner of the screen,  
**so that** I can easily access the upload functionality from anywhere on the page without losing my current view or scrolling position.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Add button is positioned as a floating element in the lower right corner of the viewport
* Button remains visible and accessible regardless of page scroll position
* Button is positioned with appropriate margin from screen edges for comfortable interaction
* Button maintains its floating position across different screen sizes and orientations
* Button does not obstruct important content or interfere with other UI elements
* Button is easily tappable/clickable with appropriate touch target size
* Floating button behavior is consistent across all pages where it appears

## Notes

* This positioning improves accessibility by providing a consistent, predictable location for the primary action
* Floating position ensures the upload functionality is always within reach, improving user experience
* Lower right corner follows common UI patterns for primary floating action buttons
* Implementation should consider z-index layering to ensure proper visibility
* May need responsive adjustments for mobile devices to account for different screen sizes
