# User Story: 8 - Improve Recipe Name Visibility on Recipe Cards ✅ COMPLETED

**As a** recipe browser,  
**I want** recipe names to have high contrast and clear visibility on recipe cards,  
**so that** I can easily read and identify recipes while browsing the gallery without straining my eyes.

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - Implementation finished on 2 October 2025

## Acceptance Criteria

* ✅ Recipe names are clearly readable with sufficient color contrast against their background
* ✅ Text color meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards for contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
* ✅ Recipe names remain legible across different lighting conditions and screen types
* ✅ Text shadow or background treatments enhance readability without compromising the medieval aesthetic
* ✅ Recipe names are easily distinguishable from background images or overlay elements
* ✅ Visibility improvements work consistently across all recipe cards in the gallery
* ✅ Changes maintain the existing jester/medieval theme while improving accessibility

## Notes

* This addresses a usability issue where low contrast makes recipe names difficult to read
* Should consider both light and dark theme compatibility if applicable
* May involve adjusting text color, background opacity, shadows, or positioning
* Ensure changes align with the existing cyber-medieval design system
* Test across different devices and screen sizes to ensure consistent visibility
